# This is my raw thoughts
# Problem
So, I have to minimize the cost of the cloud

## Description  
Team have noticed that their montly cloud costs is been increasing.

### Whats the main issue?
* Cost increases but isnt noticed by the team until its too late or maybe its noticed after they sees the bills.

* No if they came to knew that okay the cost/expenditure of the resources are increased, yet they are strugging to find what were the cause.
Maybe looking at every components might solve the issue. But time is money and we are already wasting so much.

* Im not clear what the third points is saying 
but reading it again and again what i understood that cost optimization is not easy(cant compromise the performance). So the task is to find just the top contributors to the cost.


well if the time permites we can also minimize the cost with little to no affect on the performance.
